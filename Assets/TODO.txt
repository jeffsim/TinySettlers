* Market is not requesting goods, or couriers are not seeing it as a valid place ot cleanupstorage

* Woodcutter goes to chop wood; after gathered, it looks around to see where to drop off the gathered wood
    - currently: looks for closest of [primary storage, assigned building] and drops it off there
    - but: what if there is a crafting station asking that needs wood?
        + should woodcutter carry wood directly to crafting station?
        + what if crafting station is farther than storage?


* FerryItem task:
    scenarios:
        1. building wants item for crafting purposes.  destBuilding speicified.  Creates "need for item for crafting"
        2. building wants item removed from storage.  destBuilding not specified.  Creates "need to move item to primary storage"
    - problem: if map = [storage][empty][empty][crafting][item], then courier will go from storage to item and carry it back to storage instead of crafting which needs it
    
    STORAGE / FERRY
    - option 1: FOR CLEANUP ONLY (not crafting ferry needs) -- keep Needs as-is, and when item is picked up ask "does any building actually need this item?"; 
        + if no building needs the item then continue to carry it to primary storage
        + if a building needs the item, then continue to meet the cleanup need, but do so by carrying to the crafting building  
            - AND mark the crafting-item-need as Met.  I don't think anything needs to get abandoned
    - option 2: Change how storage cleanup need works
        + not sure how, since needs are "pull" not push.
