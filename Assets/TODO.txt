* Destory Market

* Market
  - Move: 
    - move market...
    - move ...
  - Destory: 
    - destroy market while dropping in it
    - destroy market while selling...
  - Pause
    - Pause while woodcutter bringing word to it.  Works. Unpause, should bring wood
    - ALSO: On pause it leaves the market storagespot reserved but shouldn't
    - ALSO: even without pausing; doesn't unreserve

* Storage Room
  - Basic
    DropItem in storage room: unreserves storage spot
  - Move Building
        // Move storageroom while assigned worker is getting an item to store in the room
        Move storagebuilding while assigned worker is walking to another building to pick something up to store in storage room
            verify spot remains reserved, worker remains walking to other building, Location and MoveTarget are unchanged
        Move storagebuilding while assigned worker is picking up item in another building to store in storage room
            verify spot remains reserved, worker remains walking to it, Location and MoveTarget are unchanged
        Move storagebuilding while assigned worker is delivering item that it picked up in another building to store in storage room
            verify spot remains reserved, worker remains walking to it,movetarget has been updated, Location is unchanged
        Move storagebuilding while assigned worker is dropping off something in storageroom
            verify spot remains reserved, worker remains walking to it, movetarget is unchanged, Location has been updated

        // Same as above, but using worker from another room.

* Wood cutter
* ...

* add: primary storage: specify per-building hwt can be stored (defaults to 'anything')
    - silo: can only store items of type 'food'


* Add building construction
* if two workers are going to pick up items from the same storagepile then have the second one wait while the first-to-arrive is picking up their item

* major change would be: instead of fixed spots per storagepile, make it based on the item type in the pile. can store 4 logs or 16 cups or 2 stone...

* Do economic chains work?
  - add buildings: farm+wheatfield (=>wheat); well (=>water. one gatherspot); bakery (water+wheat=>bread)
  - add worker hunger

* Add building: house?

* Add buildings: forest-with-animals, and Hunter
    animals wander in tile.  new worker type.
    hunter goes and gathers them just like miner gathers stone, except the animals move.  maybe fake an arrow?
* new building forester
    goes to neighboring forest and plants trees
        that adds new gatheringspots
    also make gatheringspots run out.

* Add building: silo
    only stores type 'food'
    worker only gathers from farm spots.

* Add building: farm
    6x6 growing spots.
    can specify what type of food to growing
    
    instead of plant grow spots on farm, have them separate and farmer walks to them.
        plants grow after sowing.  different than farm
        plant spot = storagepile. can have e.g. up to 4 reapable 'storagespot' of potatoes per pile.  or I can opt to make it one.
        on the farm, have... cows/sheep.
            animal = new 'worker' type!
            farmer slaughters them to create food  
                essentially same as craftingbuilding: farmer picks up pick from [roaming] spot, carries to 'craftingspot' and slaughters it, generating meat which is carried to storage
