Add House
    - energy
        + update
        + slow down movement every .25
        + add time of day and night cycle  
            - by default go to sleep but you can override work hours
                + add happiness; goes down if make work hours too long
        + when energy reaches zero or working hours end, go to sleep   
            - if have assigned spot in house then go there
            - else sleep on ground.  energy recovery = 1/2 of normal
    - assignment to house
        + immediately upon building assign one worker per sleeping spot

+ Add eating/drinking
  - when hunger reaches 100, go to house to eat IF food there?
    + Create EatingSpot.  could be in house; could also add them to Marketplace building. etc.
        - wherever they are, that building broadcasts a need for Food.  Need increases based on hunger/available food
  - Houses broadcast need for Food.

+ Add Farm

* House added. All it does now is increase max # workers.  TBD: what to do with it?
  - Workers autoassign to house.  goes there when sleepy or hungry

* Add Building.IsActive - set to false if destroyed, paused, or under construciton.
    - create ActiveBuildings in TownData and use that everywhere instead of Buildings; remove checks

-----------
* Get rid of storagespot and repace with MultipleItemContainer in storagepile
implement needs as
	if global need for X is high and I can geenrate X if I have Y, then I hae a high need for Y.  pass the need through.
    
* add: primary storage: specify per-building hwt can be stored (defaults to 'anything')
    - silo: can only store items of type 'food'

* Combine IMultipleItemSpot and IItemSpotInBuilding into IMultipleItemSpotInBuilding (rename to IItemContainerInBuilding).  Clean up interfaces

* Add building construction
* if two workers are going to pick up items from the same storagepile then have the second one wait while the first-to-arrive is picking up their item
* Ensure that storagepiles only hold one type of item.
* major change would be: instead of fixed spots per storagepile, make it based on the item type in the pile. can store 4 logs or 16 cups or 2 stone...

* Do economic chains work?
  - add buildings: farm+wheatfield (=>wheat); well (=>water. one gatherspot); bakery (water+wheat=>bread)
  - add worker hunger

* Add buildings: forest-with-animals, and Hunter
    animals wander in tile.  new worker type.
    hunter goes and gathers them just like miner gathers stone, except the animals move.  maybe fake an arrow?

* new building forester
    goes to neighboring forest and plants trees
        that adds new gatheringspots
    also make gatheringspots run out.

* Add building: silo
    only stores type 'food'
    worker only gathers from farm spots.

* Add building: farm
    6x6 growing spots.
    can specify what type of food to growing
    
    instead of plant grow spots on farm, have them separate and farmer walks to them.
        plants grow after sowing.  different than farm
        plant spot = storagepile. can have e.g. up to 4 reapable 'storagespot' of potatoes per pile.  or I can opt to make it one.
        on the farm, have... cows/sheep.
            animal = new 'worker' type!
            farmer slaughters them to create food  
                essentially same as craftingbuilding: farmer picks up pick from [roaming] spot, carries to 'craftingspot' and slaughters it, generating meat which is carried to storage
