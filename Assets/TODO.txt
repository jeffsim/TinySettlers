* Market is not requesting goods, or couriers are not seeing it as a valid place ot cleanupstorage

* Woodcutter goes to chop wood; after gathered, it looks around to see where to drop off the gathered wood
    - currently: looks for closest of (primary storage, assigned building)
    - but: what if there is a crafting station asking that needs wood?
        + should woodcutter carry wood directly to crafting station?
        + what if crafting station is farther than storage?
