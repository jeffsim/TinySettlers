* carnation: storer carrying item to storage room; pause room, storer picks a new spot in camp; unpause; storer keeps going to camp.
  - should go to store?
* carnation: remove store.  build a new store while courer carrying item.
  - should go to store?

* ...

* add: primary storage: specify per-building hwt can be stored (defaults to 'anything')
    - silo: can only store items of type 'food'


* Add building construction
* if two workers are going to pick up items from the same storagepile then have the second one wait while the first-to-arrive is picking up their item

* major change would be: instead of fixed spots per storagepile, make it based on the item type in the pile. can store 4 logs or 16 cups or 2 stone...

* Do economic chains work?
  - add buildings: farm+wheatfield (=>wheat); well (=>water. one gatherspot); bakery (water+wheat=>bread)
  - add worker hunger

* Add building: house?

* Add buildings: forest-with-animals, and Hunter
    animals wander in tile.  new worker type.
    hunter goes and gathers them just like miner gathers stone, except the animals move.  maybe fake an arrow?
* new building forester
    goes to neighboring forest and plants trees
        that adds new gatheringspots
    also make gatheringspots run out.

* Add building: silo
    only stores type 'food'
    worker only gathers from farm spots.

* Add building: farm
    6x6 growing spots.
    can specify what type of food to growing
    
    instead of plant grow spots on farm, have them separate and farmer walks to them.
        plants grow after sowing.  different than farm
        plant spot = storagepile. can have e.g. up to 4 reapable 'storagespot' of potatoes per pile.  or I can opt to make it one.
        on the farm, have... cows/sheep.
            animal = new 'worker' type!
            farmer slaughters them to create food  
                essentially same as craftingbuilding: farmer picks up pick from [roaming] spot, carries to 'craftingspot' and slaughters it, generating meat which is carried to storage
